# liangdi.dev

My personal website built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and MDX. View it at [liangdi.dev](https://liangdi.dev).

Based on a [template](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog) made by [`@timlrx`](https://github.com/timlrx), customized to prioritize personal introduction and project showcases while maintaining blog functionality.

## Development

First, install dependencies:

```bash
yarn
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

## Deployment

Currently deployed on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), but can also be deployed on:

- [Vercel](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying)
- [Netlify](https://docs.netlify.com/frameworks/next-js/runtime-v4/overview/#next-js-runtime)
- Other static hosting services

For GitHub Pages deployment, the site uses GitHub Actions with the provided workflow in [`.github/workflows/pages.yml`](https://github.com/ligsnf/ligsnf.github.io/blob/main/.github/workflows/pages.yml).
